Week 0 — Environment Setup & Tool Installation

This week focused on building the complete development environment required for the SoC design journey. From VM setup to installing a full open-source EDA toolchain, the system is now ready for RTL → GDSII flow .

System Requirements
| Component           | Specification ✅   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **OS**              | Ubuntu 20.04+     |
| **CPU**             | 4 vCPUs           |
| **RAM**             | 6 GB+             |
| **Storage**         | 50 GB+ HDD        |


| Task                  | Description                                                     | Status |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 📂 **Repo & Docs**    | Created GitHub repo + documented intro video summary            | ✅ Done |
| 🛠️ **EDA Toolchain** | Installed + verified complete open-source flow (with snapshots) | ✅ Done |

Key Learnings

Gained hands-on experience in environment setup & dependency management for VLSI projects.

Successfully installed and verified open-source EDA toolchain on Ubuntu VM.

Established a robust base system to smoothly proceed with RTL → GDSII flow.
