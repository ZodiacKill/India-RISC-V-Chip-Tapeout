# India-RISC-V-Chip-Tapeout
Driving India's semiconductor journey with an open-source RISC-V chip tapeout. This project aims to foster collaboration and innovation in hardware design within the Indian academic and startup community. #OpenSourceHardware #RISCV #MakeInIndia

This repository serves as my digital logbook for the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, documenting my week-by-week progress, key learnings, and completed tasks.

In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation’s semiconductor ecosystem.

##  Week 0: Environment Setup & EDA Tool Installation

This week focused on setting up the complete development environment, from creating the repository to installing all the necessary open-source EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools required for the RTL-to-GDSII flow.
