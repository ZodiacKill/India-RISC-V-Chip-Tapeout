Week 1: RTL-GLS
This week focused on the core RTL → Gate-Level Synthesis (GLS) flow.

We translated behavioral Verilog into a physical netlist and verified its functional correctness through simulation, confirming the design is ready for the next stages of the physical design journey.

🧠 Key Learnings
Optimization is Key: The opt_clean -purge command acts as a garbage collector for Yosys, removing unused nets and cells to produce a clean and efficient netlist.

Yosys is Smart: The tool intelligently handles constant propagation and reset logic in flip-flops, simplifying the circuit without losing critical functionality.

Scalable Design: for-generate loops are a powerful way to write clean, modular, and scalable Verilog code for repetitive structures like MUXes, DEMUXes, and adders.

Verify Everything: Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) is a crucial step to prove that the synthesized netlist behaves exactly as the original RTL design. This prevents a simulation-synthesis mismatch.

Single Testbench: We confirmed that the same testbench can be used for both RTL and GLS, as the inputs, outputs, and overall logic remain the same—only the internal implementation is optimized.

🗺️ The RTL-GLS Flow
The process involves a series of logical steps, starting from your Verilog code and ending with a verified gate-level netlist.

RTL Design: You write your behavioral or RTL (Register Transfer Level) Verilog code, which describes your circuit's function.

Synthesis with Yosys: The Verilog code is fed into Yosys, which translates the RTL into a generic netlist, then optimizes it and maps it to a specific standard cell library (in this case, the Sky130 library).

GLS Netlist Generation: The final output of the synthesis process is a gate-level netlist, a structural description of your circuit using the standard cells from the library.

Gate-Level Simulation (GLS): The generated netlist is then simulated using a tool like Icarus Verilog. This simulation verifies that the final hardware will behave exactly as your original RTL code intended.

 Key Concepts & Learnings
 
  1. Gate-Level Simulation (GLS): GLS is a critical verification step that ensures the synthesized gate-level netlist is functionally identical to the original RTL design. It validates the structural integrity of the synthesized circuit.

  2. Latency & Blocking Assignments: Be careful with blocking (=) and non-blocking (<=) assignments. A mismatch between simulation and synthesis can occur when using blocking assignments for sequential logic, potentially leading to incorrect hardware.

  3. Latch Inference: Incomplete if or case statements can cause a synthesis tool to infer an unintended latch. This is a common design flaw that should be avoided by using a default case or ensuring all conditions are covered.
